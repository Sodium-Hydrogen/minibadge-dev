//    MINIBADGE SAMPLE CODE
//
// This code is a helpful guide for setting up the minibadge
//  to talk to the mainbadge following the minibadge 2.0 spec.
// You can use the Minibadge_debugger.ino code sample to
//  test your minibadge and make sure it is compliant.

// This provides the i2c interface. Check with your board definitions to know what pins are used for SDA and SCL.
#include "Wire.h"



//--------------------------------------------------
// Config Values
//--------------------------------------------------

// This is the 7 bit address that uniquely identifies this chip to the badge.
// Make sure you are not using the same address as another minibadge or neither
// minibadges will work.
#define ADDR 0x25


//--------Variables---------------------------------
// You can change these from setup or loop to make the minibadge more interactive.

// If you would like to let the main badge write the minibadge this should be 1.
// Otherwise to disable write support set write_support to 0.
uint8_t write_support = 1;
//Write Actions
//  1 is a score update
#define SCORE 1
//  2 is a brightness update
#define BRIGHTNESS 2


// read_action is used for telling the read interupt what to respond with.
//  0 is do nothing.
#define NOP 0
//  1 is button press.
#define BUTTON 1
//  2 is text message. If you use this then you must also set message_length and message.
#define TEXT 2

uint8_t read_action = TEXT;

// This is the length of the text message the badge will send if read_action is set to 2.
// The max length is 255. Anything larger and it cannot be sent in one byte and will
// also overflow the variable.
uint8_t message_length = 12;

// This is the message the minibadge will send when a text message read event happens.
char* message = "Hello World!";




//--------------------------------------------------
// Interupt Functions
//--------------------------------------------------

// Any variable being writen to inside an interupt Ie. request() or recieve() should be volatile.
// These are default values and will change as the badge talks to the minibadge.

//--------Read Event--------------------------------

    // message length by setting reading_state to ReadPartTwo.
    if(read_action == TEXT){
      reading_state = ReadPartTwo;

    // If read_action is anything else then set reading_state to DoNothing to indicate the minibadge
    // should not respond with anything else till the next init sequence from the badge.
    }else{
      reading_state = DoNothing;
    }

    // It is a good idea to set the read_action to zero after any value is read.
    // This will prevent the minibadge from "spamming" its message if the main badge
    // is not checking for that.
    read_action = NOP;

  // If reading_state is ReadPartTwo then the minibadge should respond with the text message length and
  // advance reading_state to ReadPartThree to let the minibadge know next read should be the text message.

    Wire.write(message_length);
    reading_state = ReadPartThree;

  // If reading_state is ReadPartThree then the minibadge should send the text message one byte at a time.
  // Once it is done it should set reading_state to ReadPartThree to let the minibadge know to do nothing
  // until the badge inits communication again.
  }else if(reading_state == ReadPartThree){

//--------Write Event-------------------------------

// writes to this minibadge.

  // This will read the first byte in the buffer into the byteOne variable.
  uint8_t byteOne = Wire.read();

  // If the first byte read is 0x00 then we know the minibadge initiation sequence was started.
  if(byteOne == 0x00){
    // This reads the next byte and will let us know if the badge wants to read (The byte is one)
    // or write to the minibadge (The byte is zero).
    reading_state = Wire.read() ? RespondRead: RespondWrite;

  // If the first byte is anythong other than 0x00 than there is a write event
  // and the minibadge will only continue reading if write_support is enabled.
  }else if(write_support == 1){

    // This is a score update. The score is two bytes long and in big endian
    // ex. if the sent score is 0x02 0xFF then the value saved to score would be
    //  0x02FF or 767.
    if(byteOne == SCORE){
      score = (((uint32_t)Wire.read()) << 8) + (uint32_t)Wire.read();
